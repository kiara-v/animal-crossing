# Modelling tiles in blender

Make the tiles equilateral triangles with edge-length 1.

Ensure you apply all scale/rotation.

Look at the blend file in `public/assets/tiles.blend`

There is a python script that will export all collections to corresponding glb files. (in retrospect - why not use ONE glb file?)
