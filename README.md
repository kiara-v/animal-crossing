## Overview

Welcome to the Animal Crossing Scene Generator, a project that combines the charm of Animal Crossing with the power of procedural generation. This project is an exploration of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm to create delightful 2D and 3D scenes inspired by the beloved Animal Crossing game. The scene generator allows you to create your very own virtual paradise where you can relax, explore, and get creative.

## Features

- **Procedural Generation:** Using the innovative Wave Function Collapse algorithm, our project generates unique and diverse scenes with every click. No two scenes will ever be the same, ensuring a constant sense of surprise and exploration.

- **Interactive Scene Rotation:** Immerse yourself in your generated scene by rotating it using your mouse. This feature adds an extra layer of interactivity and allows you to view your scene from different angles.

- **Custom Tile Placement:** Tailor your scene to your liking by choosing specific tiles to place on the grid. This hands-on approach lets you create a scene that's truly your own.

- **Animal Crossing Theme:** We've drawn inspiration from Animal Crossing, a beloved life simulation video game, to infuse a cozy, charming atmosphere into your procedurally generated scenes. Whether you want to recreate the vibe of your favorite Animal Crossing village or craft a whole new world, our project has you covered.

- **Triangular Tiles:** Our project employs triangular tiles, a clever approach that minimizes the number of unique tiles you need to create. This not only simplifies the process but also gives a unique aesthetic to your scenes.

- **Adjacency Constraints:** We've meticulously defined adjacency constraints for our set of tiles. These constraints ensure that tiles connect harmoniously, creating a visually pleasing and coherent scene. You'll find various ways to implement these constraints, such as manual configuration, color matching, boundary profiles, and more.

- **Least Entropy Heuristic:** To drive the procedural generation, we've implemented the least entropy heuristic. This means that the algorithm intelligently decides which block to collapse at each step, resulting in more interesting and diverse scenes.
